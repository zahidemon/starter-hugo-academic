A Computer Science(CS) PhD student at the University of Utah with an interest in Data Analysis, Deep Learning and Web application development. I also work as a Research Assistant at the [Elhabian Lab of SCI, University of Utah](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~shireen/group.html) where I am working on different deep learning based statistical shape modeling for medical images. 

I completed my bachelor's from Rajshahi Univerisity of Engineering & Technology, Bangladesh where I started my research journey by working on various deep learning applications in bioinformatics-related projects. I also worked at a start-up after my undergraduate degree. There, I worked on a wide range of aspects, from implementing research methodologies to deploying ML/DL models to production for public usage.
