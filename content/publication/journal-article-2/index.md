abstract: Cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases in the world that often leads to misery and death. Current treatments include different kinds of anticancer therapy which exhibit different types of side effects. Because of certain physicochemical properties, anticancer peptides (ACPs) have opened a new path of treatments for this deadly disease. That is why a well-performed methodology for identifying novel anticancer peptides has great importance in the fight against cancer. In addition to the laboratory techniques, various machine learning and deep learning methodologies have developed in recent years for this task. Although these models have shown reasonable predictive ability, there's still room for improvement in terms of performance and exploring new types of algorithms. In this work, we have proposed a novel multi-channel convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying anticancer peptides from protein sequences. We have collected data from the existing state-of-the-art methodologies and applied binary encoding for data preprocessing. We have also employed k-fold cross-validation to train our models on benchmark datasets and compared our models' performance on the independent datasets. The comparison has indicated our models' superiority on various evaluation metrics. We think our work can be a valuable asset in finding novel anticancer peptides.
